While all of the songs listed below are amazing works of art, the best Britney Spears 
song of all time is <i>Toxic</i>. <i>Toxic</i> is great for all occasions, 
whether you are showering, driving, dancing, being by yourself, or whatever! 
<i>Slave 4 U</i> is another great Britney song that is often overlooked and uses 
the super trendy concept of abbreviating words. The music video for this song is
 also a must see for everyone. It features yet another one of Britney’s many talents:
 amazing dancing.  <i>Chris Cox Megamix</i> is my favorite song to listen to because it
 is a very cohesive mashup of all of Britney’s top hits. Although it’s not on any of her
 official produced albums, you can find it on her top hits album.
